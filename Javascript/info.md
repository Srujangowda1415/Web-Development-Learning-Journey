Javascript handles the functionality, without javascript you cannot make real world websites.

FUN FACT: Websites use JS to show ads.. on certain websites you can turn your javascript off and then you wont see ads, but mind you without javascript most websites chalengi bhi nahi!

Why javascript is called javascript? is it similar to java?
Java and javascript have as much similarity as car and carpet have

Javascript is an interpreted language and not a compiled language...
Earlier interpreted languages were considered as toy languages and only the compiled languages were considered as real languages and seemed to be useful and powerful..
but then..
python and javascript were released and we all know what happened after that

now js does all sorts of work..
js is widely supported
