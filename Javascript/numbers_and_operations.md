**ARITHMETIC OPERATORS**

arithmetic operators are our usual mathematical operators simple se

Addition(+)

Subtraction(-)

Multiplication(*)

Exponentiation(**)

Division(/)

Remainder(%)

Increment(++)

Decrement(--)

x++ and ++x are too different things

x++ will call x first and then increment it, however, ++x will increment x first and then call it


**ASSIGNMENT OPERATOR**
assignment operators are just shortcuts, personally mujhe toh useless lagte hai

x=x+3       x+=3

x=x-3.      x-=3

**EQUALITY OPERATORS**

we have two types of equality operators

strict equality ===

this is known as strict equality operator because this guy is really strict, when this comes in picture he makes sure the two values in equal all aways, from the value to the datatype too.

suppose you try to check for 2 three's, one is a string and another one is a number 

this strict guy wont let you equate them and give you a false output

lose equality ==

this guy is a lil lenient he will just check for values if they are equal, it will give true
