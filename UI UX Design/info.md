Web design is a very essential part of web development, or we can say they go hand in handd....
people will never appreciate your website's good functionality, yeah they will criticise it if its not functional but they will never appreciate it if it works properly..
weird and unfair right? koi naa tu bhi aisa hi hai

what they will appreciate is the website's design, so designing a website is very essential part of making a good website, in fact front end is nothing without a web design

so we saw a website which is very colour very finicky very too much... mera taste bhi yahi hai simple classy toh zyada colours bhi ache nahi hai..

there are various pillars of web design we will discuss them all briefly:

1. Colour Theory
2. Typography
3. User Interface Design
4. User Experience Design
