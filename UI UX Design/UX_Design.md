The concept of User Experience Design focus on making the experience of your users better on your webpage..
we can consider an example
so there was a bigggg college, it had to be renovated they contacted a very famous architect, he renovated it completely but left the pathways or the footpaths he just let it be a big piece of grasslands...
the deans of the college were confused they asked the architect raasta kyu nahi banaya bhai? the architect said ek saal me khud se banenge or vo natural raaste honge jo logo ko actually chahiye ham fir usko properly bana denge.
this shows us how we should not force our users into something rather.. we should see what they like and what is comfortable for them and then work on it.
