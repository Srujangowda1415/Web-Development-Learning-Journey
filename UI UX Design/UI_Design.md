UI Design helps us to design us things in a way which makes it easier for the user to get the info and make the content more readable.
we know ki sabse pehle we will see the biggest thing on the screen the most square thing,

**Colour**
colours matters a lot.. maybe use a little subtle colours for not so important things or the things which dont require a lot of attention and are just there for the aesthetic and use more vibrant and contrasty colours for the things you want the user to pay attention to.
**SIZE**
simple si cheez hai jispe zyada focus chahiye uska size bada kar de
jo cheez actually important hai tere liye usey bada size de... jaise abhi ek wesbite dekhi usme upar hero section tha badaa sa text tha bada paragraph bhi tha but mera dhyan bas email daalo or get started vale button par gaya why? because it was bigger than hero text itself... their purpose is fulfilled if you put your email and click on get started or vo hua bhi
**LAYOUT**
you would not want to put a very big block of text ek hi jagah pe rather divide into paras insert an image and keep the line length also short so that its easily readable
**ALIGNMENT**
reduce the number of alignment points
**WHITE SPACE**
make sure you leave a lot of white space
just imagine a mall where a lot of footwears are kept but all spacious where every footwear has its space to flaunt itself and show its beauty and at the same time you have a shop saare joote bhare hue ek hi jagah pe that will look really cheap.

**\* KNOW YOUR AUDIENCE... KEEP IN MIND WHAT YOUR AUDIENCE WANTS AND DESIGN ACCORDINGLY...**
