Colour theory tells us to use different colours for different occassions and purposes.
For example
**_RED_**
Red Represents love, it represents intensity and energy... lot of car manufacturers make red cars.. that is to signify their energetic powerful feel

**_YELLOW_**
Yellow represents Joy and YELLOW IS THE MOST ATTENTION SEEKING COLOUR.. you will tend to notice the yellow the most or give yellow the most of your attention because it just stands out because it is really bright so when you need someone's attention immediately use yellow.
yellow is great for a logo or a headline but when you are designing something that your user will look at for a long time you might not want to use yellow as its not very pleasing to look at for a long time it will start to hurt your eyes very soon

**_GREEN_**
Green represents freshness,nature,safety and growth
when you want your clients to trust you you use green.
most of the groceries use green themes
**_BlUE_**
Blue represents stability and trust
financial companies need trust so they use blue themes
the next time you go for an interview or maybe a date where you actually want the girl just try wearing somehting blue and they might trust you a little more than usual

**_PURPLE_**
Purple represents loyalty and feminity

\***\*COLOUR PALLETTE\*\***
so you have already seen a coloured circle at the back of your drawing book right so that is a colour wheel
we make colour palletes using that there are primarily two types of colour pallettes.

1. Analogous Colour Pallete
2. Complimentary colour pallette

**ANALOGOUS COLOUR PALLETTE**
So analogous colour pallette is formed when you choose two adjacent colours from the colour wheel... you get a very soft tone very soothing and you can use it for navbars,logos and stuff like those but dont consider this when you want to make something stand out

**COMPLIMENTARY COLOUR PALLETTE**
so a complimentary colour pallette is formed when you choose two opposite colours on the colour wheel.. then you get something very vibrant something which stands out very well
but never use it on text and its background it will look really bad.
