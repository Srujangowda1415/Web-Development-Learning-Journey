COMBINING MULTIPLE SELECTORS
we can select more than elements at once using a comma
supose:
h1,h2{}

CHILD SELECTOR
we can use the following syntax the child div of a parent div but keep in mind this works only for the immediate kid of the div and not further branches
parent-div > child-div

DESCENDANT SELECTION
we can select any element from a div using:
.inner-box p
now here it will select all the paragraphs inside our div with class name inner-box

the only difference between child selection and descendant selection is that child one only works for immediate child and descendant one works for further branches
