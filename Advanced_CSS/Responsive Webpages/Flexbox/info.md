Earlier we used to use table tag in html to make a layout for the website.
we tried making a table and it was not that good.
we still use tables in modern day coding, however, use it only for tabular data but not for webpage layout
because we have much better ways and technologies now.
Earlier float was used too to make layouts, but it is ot recommended too.
