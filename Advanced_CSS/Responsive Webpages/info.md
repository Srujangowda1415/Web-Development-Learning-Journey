Responsive webpages are those who are completely functional and look pretty on devices of all kinds of widths and heights. We need to use CSS in a certain way to make sure your webpages are responsive.
There are 4 ways to make sure the webpages you make are responsive.

1. Media Queries
2. CSS Grid
3. CSS Flexbox
4. Using external frameworks like Bootsrap or Tailwind

MEDIA QUERIES
Media Queries are the instructions you give to your CSS Sheets which specify a condition, which when fulfilled, certain instructions are to be followed,
these instructions usually instruct the code to change the values of one or more properties which in turn makes sure that your webpage becomes responsive.

CSS Grid
CSS grids are table like structures, the merit of using these over conventional div tables is that these are comparatively easier and shorter to code.
Grid is a value to the display property.

CSS Flexbox
Grid is basically a 2d layout, and a flexbox is a 1d layout
making a layout either vertically or horizontally is done by flexbox
