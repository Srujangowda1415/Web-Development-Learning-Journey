There are mainlu 4 types of display properties in CSS
They are as follows:

1. Block
2. Inline
3. Inline-block

You already know what they do, how they function
the main thing to note is that
block lets you decide its height width and all measurements
inline gives you no control over the measurement of the element, it will arrange itself in a way to adjust everything in it's line
inline-block is the mix of both, it will let you decide the measurement of the element and yet if there is space it will let other elements be in line. it will automatically shift to a new line if it doesnt have enough space in that particular line
