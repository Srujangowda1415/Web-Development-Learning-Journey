There are 4 ways to position a div or position anything as a matter of fact

1. Static
2. Relative
3. Absolute
4. Fixed

STATIC POSITIOING
Static postioning is the default html positioning, you dont even need to mention static positioning to use it.
it will position your element according to the conventional html flow

RELATIVE POSITIONING
now this positioning will let you set the position relative to the original or the static positioning of the element.
suppose we position an element relatively, and give a left of 50px then the element will be pushed 50px from the static position of the element

ABSOLUTE POSITIONING
this will position your div relative to the immediate parent of the element, in case there is no parent then it will be positioned relative to the top left corner of the webpage.
the absolute positioning will set the z index of the element to the max, actually it wont change the z index but it will create a new layer and the element will be kept in that layer.

FIXED POSITIONING
this will position your element relative to the top left corner of the webpage and when you use this the element will stay right there, which means, even when you scroll down the webpage the element will be fixed there or we can say it will be sticked there
