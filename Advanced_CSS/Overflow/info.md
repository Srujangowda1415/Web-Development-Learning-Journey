The overflow property in CSS controls how content is handled when it exceeds the boundaries of its containing element. This is particularly useful for creating scrollable elements or preventing content from spilling over into neighboring elements.

Values:

visible:

Default value.
Content overflows the element's boundaries.
No clipping or scrolling occurs.
hidden:

Content is clipped and hidden.
Any content outside the element's boundaries is not visible.
scroll:

Scrollbars are added to the element, allowing users to scroll through the content.
This is useful for creating scrollable sections within a page.
auto:

Scrollbars are added only if necessary.
If the content fits within the element's boundaries, no scrollbars are shown.
